# IrisDataLogisticRegression

--------------------------------------

The Iris Flower data set is probably the most versatile, easy and resourceful dataset in pattern recognition literature. Nothing could be better than the Iris dataset to learn classification techniques. The data has only 150 rows & 4 columns.
In the project, we created a classification (Logistic Regression) model to predict on the Iris species.
